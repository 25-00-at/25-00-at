<sub>_fine, sorry for ghosting you or not interacting with you anymore even though were green names. im not good at communicating, will try what i can to talk to you but if you ignore me it makes me feel pretty bad, ill be completely silent because i feel i have disturbed you. just unf or block me, it is normal to cut off an online relationship when there is no more interaction._<sub/>
